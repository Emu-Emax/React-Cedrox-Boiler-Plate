## Cedrox React Boiler
Feel free to download/fork to kick start your new project ^^

My own boiler created as a result from working in different React projects.

Brief features (see full list here):
* Friendly, scalable structure
* Typescript, tsx 100%, types folder
* Only functional components with interfaces
* Unit and snapshot tests
* Styled Components integration for custom styling
* Constants and utils separated
* Few universal hooks for life
* Scalable redux - redux toolkit, thunk, listeners and middleware
* Env variables
* Few universal components to build app with
* Router with layout
* Dark / Light mode switch as an example (kept in LocalStorage)
* localStorage manager


TODO:
* Spies and mocks for testing
* TS support for tests
* Responsiveness (declared media queries with easy access to them)
* loader component
* global reject listener

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
